This project is a combination of 2 games: Tetris and 2048. By controlling tetrominoes, which are various shapes composed of four blocks each, as they fall onto a grid. Every block is identified by a number that denotes its value. At first, the tetrominoes are just randomly assigned with 2 or 4 numbers on them. Blocks that have the same number merged together earn points. Points are awarded based on the value of the combined block, which doubles when two identical vertical blocks come into contact with each other.
By carefully combining blocks, the goal is to get to a block that has the number 2048. To clear full rows, you also try to fill them with blocks. You gain points for clearing rows as well, which are determined by adding up the block values in the row. Handling tiles can be implemented by either dropping free tiles or deleting them and adding their value to the score. Chain merging is used to determine the merging order from bottom to top. As long as you can move, the game will go on; however, if any block hits the top of the grid, it will finish. Reaching a 2048 block and getting the greatest score before the game ends is the ultimate challenge.

The settings are added. When the music volume button is pressed, music and difficulty are displayed on the screen. All of these features can be adjusted. The volume of the music can be increased or decreased. The music can also be shut down. When the music is on, the color of the button is green, and when it is off, the button is red. The difficulty of the game can be changed to easy, normal, or hard. Actually, the difficulty setting is based on the speed of the tetrominoes falling down. The score and the high score are displayed. The score is updated according to the addition of the merged tetrominoes and the addition of the blocks in a deleted row. A hard drop for tetrominoes to fall very fast with the space bar is appended. The next tetromino can be seen. Moreover, with the pause button, the game can be paused. After pausing three options appear: continue, restart, and exit. The game can be continued, restarted, or exited. The implementation of handling free tiles is that they fall and not stay put. There are two winning goals. One is creating a 2048 block and the other one is reaching the 2048 score. If the user wins the message “You win!” is shown, otherwise “You lose!” message is displayed on the screen. In either case, “game over” and the score is written. Finally, after winning or losing, the user can restart the game or go to the main menu or settings.
